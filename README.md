## Bubble Sort Implementation In Ruby Language

> This project implements a bubble sort algorithm in Ruby. An unsorted array is passed to the bubble sort method with a Ruby block. The bubble sort method then passes execution to a block using the yield keyword, but only if a block was passed. A sorted array (in ascending order) is returned. The second method, bubble_sort_by is passed a block which returns the desired sorting order, ascending or descending string length.
